\title{Log-likelihood of the State Space Model.}
\usage{
\method{logLik}{SSModel}(object, marginal = FALSE, nsim = 0,
  antithetics = TRUE, theta, check.model = TRUE, transform = c("ldl",
  "augment"), maxiter = 50, seed, convtol = 1e-08, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{State space model of class \code{SSModel}.}

\item{marginal}{Logical. Compute marginal instead of diffuse likelihood (see
details). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{nsim}{Number of independent samples used in estimating the
log-likelihood of the non-Gaussian state space model. Default is 0, which
gives good starting value for optimization. Only used for non-Gaussian
model.}

\item{antithetics}{Logical. If TRUE, two antithetic variables are used in
simulations, one for location and another for scale. Default is TRUE. Only
used for non-Gaussian model.}

\item{theta}{Initial values for conditional mode theta. Only used for
non-Gaussian model.}

\item{check.model}{Logical. If TRUE, function \code{is.SSModel} is called
before computing the likelihood. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{transform}{How to transform the model in case of non-diagonal
covariance matrix \eqn{H}. Defaults to \code{"ldl"}. See function
\code{\link{transformSSM}} for details.}

\item{maxiter}{The maximum number of iterations used in linearisation.
Default is 50. Only used for non-Gaussian model.}

\item{seed}{The value is used as a seed via \code{set.seed} function. Only used for
non-Gaussian model.}

\item{convtol}{Tolerance parameter for convergence checks for Gaussian
approximation.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Log-likelihood of the model.

\description{
Function \code{logLik.SSmodel} computes the log-likelihood value of a state
space model.
}
\details{
As KFAS is based on diffuse initialization, the log-likelihood is also diffuse,
which coincides with restricted likelihood (REML) in an appropriate (mixed)
models. However, in typical REML estimation constant term \eqn{log|X'X|} is
omitted from the log-likelihood formula. Similar term is also missing in
diffuse log-likelihood formulations of state space models, but unlike in simpler
linear models this term is not necessarily constant. Therefore omitting this
term can lead to suboptimal results in model estimation if there is unknown
parameters in diffuse parts of Zt or Tt (Francke et al. 2011). Therefore
so called marginal log-likelihood (diffuse likelihood + extra term) is
recommended. See also Gurka (2006) for model comparison in mixed model
settings using REML with and without the additional (constant) term.
The marginal log-likelihood can be computed by setting \code{marginal = TRUE}.

Note that for non-Gaussian models with importance sampling derivative-free
optimization methods such as Nelder-Mead might be more reliable than methods
which use finite difference approximations. This is due to noise caused by
the relative stopping criterion used for finding approximating Gaussian
model.
