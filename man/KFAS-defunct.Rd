\description{
The function listed here are removed from KFAS.
}
\details{
Subset-based methods were removed as they were somewhat confusingly
named as the \code{subset} generic in \code{base}, and most likely not
that useful (compared to \code{\link{[<-.SSModel}}).

Deviance.KFS was removed as it was mostly useless. The value was not a \eqn{-2*(logL-logL*)}
where \eqn{L} is the likelihood and \eqn{L*} is the saturated likelihood.
Instead it was based on the conditional likelihood \eqn{p(y|theta)} i.e. it disregards
the effect of hidden states. Therefore the value
returned by this function did not make much sense in non-GLM setting.

From \code{rstandard.KFS} and \code{residuals.KFS}: Computation of deviance residuals. 
This option was meant to be used only for the GLM comparisons, as their 
generalization to other models is lacking, but in order to avoid misleading 
results in non-GLM settings, these are now completely removed.
