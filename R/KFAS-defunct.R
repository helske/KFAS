#' Defunct Functions of Package KFAS
#'
#' The function listed here are removed from KFAS.
#'
#' Subset-based methods were removed as they were somewhat confusingly
#' named as the \code{subset} generic in \code{base}, and most likely not
#' that useful (compared to \code{\link{[<-.SSModel}}).
#'
#' Deviance.KFS was removed as it was mostly useless. The value was not a \eqn{-2*(logL-logL*)}
#' where \eqn{L} is the likelihood and \eqn{L*} is the saturated likelihood.
#' Instead it was based on the conditional likelihood \eqn{p(y|theta)} i.e. it disregards
#' the effect of hidden states. Therefore the value
#' returned by this function did not make much sense in non-GLM setting.
#' 
#' From \code{rstandard.KFS} and \code{residuals.KFS}: Computation of deviance residuals. 
#' This option was meant to be used only for the GLM comparisons, as their 
#' generalization to other models is lacking, but in order to avoid misleading 
#' results in non-GLM settings, these are now completely removed.
