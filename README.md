KFAS: R Package for Exponential Family State Space Models
==========================================================================

Package KFAS provides tools for modelling exponential family state space models such as
structural time series, ARIMA models, generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models.

Main features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Kalman filtering
- Fixed interval smoothing (Kalman smoothing)
- Simulation smoothing of Gaussian models
- Importance sampling of non-Gaussian models
- Exact diffuse initialization
- Multivariate models with mixed distributions


Current version of KFAS in CRAN is 1.0.3.
